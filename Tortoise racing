Problem:

Two tortoises named A and B must run a race. A starts with an average speed of 720 feet per hour. Young B knows she runs faster than A, and furthermore has not finished her cabbage.

When she starts, at last, she can see that A has a 70 feet lead but B's speed is 850 feet per hour. How long will it take B to catch A?

More generally: given two speeds v1 (A's speed, integer > 0) and v2 (B's speed, integer > 0) and a lead g (integer > 0) how long will it take B to catch A?

The result will be an array [hour, min, sec] which is the time needed in hours, minutes and seconds (don't worry for fractions of second).

Solution:
function race($v1, $v2, $g) {
    // your code
    if($v1<$v2){
      
      $hour = floor($g/($v2-$v1));
      
      $min=floor(($g%($v2-$v1))*60/($v2-$v1));
      
      $sec=floor((($g%($v2-$v1))*60)%($v2-$v1)*60/($v2-$v1));
      
      return $timeItTakes = array($hour,$min,$sec);
    }
    else 
    {
      return null;
    }
}
